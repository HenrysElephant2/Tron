Features:
One of our most prominent features is bloom. Adding bloom to the program gives the impression that the colored strips are actually lit and glowing and contributes greatly to the overall effect of the image. We also added particle explosions on player death to give a basic impression of the bikes shattering into thousands of fragments as in the movie. Finally, we used transparency to give the impression of reflections in the floor and to make the trails the glassy look they have in the movie.
